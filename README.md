# Automated Resume Parsing Using OCR and spaCy

This project implements an automated resume parsing system using Python, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques with spaCy.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to automatically extract relevant candidate information from resumes without manual review. The system processes resumes in PDF format, cleans and normalizes extracted text, applies Named Entity Recognition (NER), and outputs structured data.

## Features
- Extract text from PDF resumes
- Clean and normalize text using regex and string processing
- Perform Named Entity Recognition (NER) using spaCy
- Extract candidate details such as name, email, phone number, skills, and entities
- Store results in structured formats using Pandas

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- spaCy
- pdfplumber
- pytesseract
- pandas

## Output
The final output is a structured dataset containing parsed resume information.
